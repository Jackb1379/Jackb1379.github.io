	<h1>Jackb</h1>
	<p>Hello, welcome to my website. Honestly switching from paid web hosting to github pages was the best desicion of my life, even though it means no PHP (I never really understood PHP anyway) so yeah here is a list of stuff that I've put on here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="minecraft-links">Minecraft links</a> for server development</li>
		<li><a href="server-helper">Server Helper</a> (this is my discord bot that I'm working on when I get the chance)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Jackb1379">Jackb1379</a> (link to my github account)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Jackb1379/Jackb1379.github.io">Github pages repository</a> (source code)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>WARNING: read my source code at your own risk: there are lots of deprecated html elements which really shouldn't work anymore but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
	<p>Have fun</p>
